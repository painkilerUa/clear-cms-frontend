Hello, I'm Dominic Christian, I'm the
chairman of inclusion at Lloyd's

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.960
I'm the CEO  of Aon UK Ltd.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.700
I think whatever we do, where we work,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.200
whatever our industry is, whatever firm
it is, what we want to do, always - promote

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.350
a culture that's welcoming, fair, open and
contemporary. And young people today

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.769
demand it of us. They're far more
knowledgeable than multiculturalism,

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.510
gender choice and a deep personal choice.
So if we're to attract people to our

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.480
industry, we've got to actually get
D&amp;I right.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.940
The business case is very clear:
diversity leads to inclusion, inclusion

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.000
leads to higher employee engagement,
higher employee engagement leads to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.710
increase productivity. QED. It's very
important for insurance and reinsurance

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.870
that everyone plays their part. For the
simple reason that this industry has

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.160
become a team game. To do good work for
clients you have to be teaming. Not any

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.789
one of us has all the answers for a
client. Between however our teams, we do.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.320
And clients want various views and those
various views are created through an

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.559
effective team network.
That's why all of us playing our part is

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.720
important. I think there's a couple of
reasons

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.070
why going global is so exciting for us.
For start about 85% of our client base

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.110
in the London market is international
and anything that eases the contact with

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.570
our international client base, which is
so critical to all of us, must be good.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.600
Secondly it's quite odd if you think
about diversity and inclusion for not to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.369
be global, for not to be broader than
just the UK. What we're trying to do is

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.259
attract all sorts backgrounds approaches
and types of people to our industry, from

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.640
abroad as well as from this country.  
One of the reasons why diversity and

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.320
inclusion is so important is about
understanding the range of new risks

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.170
that we're trying to think through. And
to do that, we're going to need creative

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.310
talents and perhaps employ people from
different avenues from those that we

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.950
usually do to our industry. The number of
senior employments in our industry have

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.939
come from people or are people in
position who actually come from various

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.560
backgrounds.
And various approaches have come into

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.340
the industry various ways and all this
leads to, I think, much greater confidence

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.660
about what kind of industry we are and
actually what D&amp;I means to insurance.
